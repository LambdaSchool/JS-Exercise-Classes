  STRETCH PROBLEM (no tests!)
    - Extend the functionality of the Student by adding a prop called grade and setting it equal to a number between 1-100.
    - Now that our students have a grade build out a method on the Instructor (this will be used by _BOTH_ instructors and PM's) that will randomly add or subtract points to a student's grade. _Math.random_ will help.
    - Add a graduate method to a student.
      + This method, when called, will check the grade of the student and see if they're ready to graduate from Lambda School
      + If the student's grade is above a 70% let them graduate! Otherwise go back to grading their assignments to increase their score.
